=head1 DESCRIPTION

So how do you manage your articles?  Before using C<Beagle>, I managed them
poorly: they were plain files messily living in the hard drive.

That way is not good, as I had to find the file's location before doing
something on it, which could be depressing if I couldn't remember the location
at all(it did happen for a few times), not to mention sharing or the version
control stuff.

L<git|http://git-scm.com/> is a great version control system. With it, you can
version control your files and share them easily, though C<git> itself
can't help you much of finding files' locations.

Things are more bothersome if you use some markup language such as C<Wiki> or
L<Markdown|http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/> in your posts.  It
would be awesome if you can get them converted to html automatically and check
if something is wrong before publishing.

C<Beagle> was born for this, and more.
