Beagle::Manual::Cookbook - Cookbook

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Add a new entry type

To add a new type "Foo" with an extra meta key "category", you just need to
create a module Beagle::Model::Foo which inherits from Beagle::Model::Entry.

    package Beagle::Model::Foo;
    use Any::Moose;
    extends 'Beagle::Model::Entry';
    
    has 'category' => (
        isa     => 'Str',
        is      => 'rw',
        default => '',
    );

    1;


That's it, now you have foo and foos commands automatically.

You can also add the new type to a plugin like C<Beagle::Plugin::Bar> and
change its name to C<Beagle::Plugin::Bar::Model::Foo>. if so, the new type
is loaded only if you load the plugin.
