Beagle::Manual::Cookbook - Cookbook

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Add a new entry type

to add a new type "Foo" with an extra meta key "category", you just need to
create a module Beagle::Model::Foo which inherits from Beagle::Model::Entry.
that's it.

    package Beagle::Model::Foo;
    use Any::Moose;
    extends 'Beagle::Model::Entry';
    
    has 'category' => (
        isa     => 'Str',
        is      => 'rw',
        default => '',
    );

    1;


now you have foo and foos commands automatically.
